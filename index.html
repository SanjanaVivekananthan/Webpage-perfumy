        <h1>AboutUs</h1>
        <p id="a" >One often visits a store to search for perfume; what is the first thing one looks at? The exterior of the perfume. The art and aesthetic behind the perfume bottle play a vital role in attracting people. What if I serve you a good dinner on an old, broken plate? Will you be interested in eating? No, right, because it doesn't satisfy your eye. The concept is pretty much very similar.</p>

        <p id="c" style="color: lightgray;">Thus, perfume aesthetics is a game that leaves an impact on our minds for a long time. Perfume is now not only limited to the scent it is or from the family it comes from. It has become a broader concept that one needs to understand before oneâ€™s next shopping spree.</p>
